"""
MCP server that exposes five tools: execute_command, read_file, write_file,
delete_file, and list_directory.

Policy rules are loaded from policy.json at startup. Every tool call passes
through the policy engine (blocked → requires_confirmation →
requires_simulation → allowed) before any I/O is performed. Blocked calls
are logged and rejected. Allowed file writes are backed up first; allowed
commands are optionally backed up and then executed via subprocess.

Every log entry written to activity.log is produced by build_log_entry() and
carries a session_id (UUID4, stable for the process lifetime) and a workspace
field so audit records from concurrent or sequential server instances can be
correlated and scoped to the correct working directory.
