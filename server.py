    Delete a single file after creating a backup, subject to policy checks.

    Sequence:
      1. Path is checked against policy (blocked paths, extensions, whitelist).
      2. If the path does not exist, a clear error is returned — this is not
         a policy block, the operation simply cannot proceed.
      3. If the path is a directory, the request is blocked — use
         execute_command for directory operations.
      4. A timestamped backup is created with backup_paths() before any
         destructive action is taken.
      5. The file is deleted with os.remove().

    Every call is logged to activity.log regardless of outcome. Successful
    deletions include backup_location in the log so the file is always
