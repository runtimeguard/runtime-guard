# ai-runtime-guard

A development MCP server that adds a security/policy layer in front of AI-agent filesystem and shell actions.

Operator reference:
- `MANUAL.md` contains the current behavioral guide (matching semantics, tier precedence, retries, budgets, UI metadata limits, and release gates).

## What this is
- Python MCP server with a thin entrypoint (`server.py`) and modular runtime components:
  - `policy_engine.py`, `approvals.py`, `budget.py`
  - `backup.py`, `audit.py`, `executor.py`
  - tool handlers under `tools/`
- Exposes guarded tools: `server_info`, `execute_command`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `delete_file`, `list_directory`, `restore_backup`.
- Policy-driven enforcement loaded from `policy.json` at startup.
- Audit-first behavior with JSONL logs in `activity.log` and pre-change backups in `backups/`.

## How to run
1. `cd /Users/liviu/Documents/ai-runtime-guard`
2. `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Optional workspace override: `export AIRG_WORKSPACE=/absolute/path/to/sandbox`
5. Start MCP server over stdio: `python server.py`

## Local policy UI (v3)
React + Tailwind frontend (Vite) with a Flask backend.

Backend:
1. `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python3 ui/backend_flask.py`

Frontend:
1. `cd ui_v3`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

Current UI v3 scope:
- three-layer navigation rail + command tabs + main panel
- approvals panel with polling and approve/deny actions
- command table with tier columns, tooltip descriptions, status badges, retry/budget metadata editors
- advanced JSON editor (bidirectional with table state)
- validate/apply/reload flows against Flask REST API

## How to test
Primary workflow (recommended for destructive-behavior testing):
1. Register this MCP server in your AI agent/client.
2. Point `AIRG_WORKSPACE` to a disposable directory dedicated to test runs.
3. Run tool-driven scenarios, especially:
   - blocked destructive commands (`rm -rf`, `dd`, sensitive paths/extensions)
   - simulation-gated wildcard deletes (`rm *.tmp`) over/under threshold
   - confirmation handshake (`execute_command` -> human approves in GUI/API -> re-run)
   - backup + recovery checks for write/delete/command-modify paths
   - cumulative budget checks (multiple sub-threshold commands should still hit aggregate limits)

Optional local unit tests in this repo:
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'`

## Merge and branch policy (MVP lock-down)
1. Development happens on feature branches (currently `refactor`), not `main`.
2. Merge path is `refactor` -> `main` only after the pre-merge gate is satisfied.
3. `main` should be protected in GitHub settings: no direct pushes, at least one review, and required checks before merge.
4. Approval separation at MCP tool surface is complete (approval remains out-of-band via GUI/API).

## Minimum pre-merge gate
1. Unit security regressions pass:
   - `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'`
2. Manual MCP integration validation passes for at least 12 prompts from `tests.md`, including:
   - 3 blocked destructive command scenarios
   - 2 confirmation-handshake scenarios
   - 2 simulation scenarios (threshold + unresolved wildcard)
   - 2 cumulative-budget anti-bypass scenarios
   - 1 restore flow scenario (dry-run token + apply)
   - 2 network-policy scenarios
3. Linux checkpoint before MVP release:
   - run the same unit suite on Linux
   - execute a reduced manual prompt set on Linux and record outcomes in `STATUS.md`
4. Approval separation checkpoint:
   - approvals come from a separate trusted/operator channel (GUI/API), not MCP tool calls
   - initiating agent cannot self-approve via MCP tool surface
