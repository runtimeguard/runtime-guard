# Telemetry

AIRG supports optional anonymous telemetry to help improve product quality and prioritization.

## What Is Collected
When enabled, AIRG sends one aggregate payload per UTC day to:

- `https://telemetry.runtime-guard.ai/v1/telemetry`

Example payload:

```json
{
  "airg_version": "2.3.1.dev",
  "platform": "macos",
  "python_version": "3.12.3",
  "install_method": "unknown",
  "agents_bucket": "1",
  "agent_types": ["cursor"],
  "events_bucket": "11-50",
  "blocked_bucket": "2-5",
  "approvals_bucket": "0",
  "sentinel_enabled": true,
  "sentinel_flagged_bucket": "1",
  "sentinel_blocked_bucket": "0",
  "period_days": 1
}
```

## What Is Not Collected

- No command text.
- No file contents or file paths.
- No prompt/completion text.
- No usernames, emails, hostnames, or machine identifiers.
- No install ID or persistent telemetry identifier.
- No high-resolution timestamps (daily aggregate only).

## Opt In / Opt Out

- During setup/update, AIRG prompts for telemetry opt-in (default is Yes).
- You can change telemetry preference at any time in GUI: `Policy -> Advanced -> Anonymous telemetry`.
- GUI `Enable/Disable` writes directly to policy (`telemetry.enabled`) and is the runtime source of truth.
- Runtime behavior does not rely on legacy telemetry env-var toggles; use policy/GUI controls.

## Payload Preview

- In `Policy -> Advanced -> Anonymous telemetry`, click `See Payload`.
- AIRG shows the exact JSON shape/value that would be sent.

## Endpoint And Delivery

- Default endpoint: `https://telemetry.runtime-guard.ai/v1/telemetry`
- Method: `POST` JSON (`Content-Type: application/json`)
- Timeout: 5 seconds total
- Retries: implicit via outbox persistence (failed uploads remain queued)
- Failures are logged to `activity.log` telemetry events
- Success is HTTP `204 No Content`
- AIRG sets an explicit `User-Agent` header for telemetry requests.
- AIRG telemetry scheduler runs every 60 minutes and starts generator/uploader workers in parallel.
- Generator creates one payload per UTC day when enabled and writes it to the telemetry outbox.
- Uploader scans outbox payloads and POSTs them to the configured endpoint.
- Worker stand-down behavior:
  - telemetry disabled: both stand down
  - generator already ran today: generator stands down
  - uploader no payloads: uploader stands down
- Outbox location: `<state_dir>/telemetry/telemetry-YYYY-MM-DD.json` where `<state_dir>` is the directory containing `approvals.db`.

To point to a different endpoint, set `policy.telemetry.endpoint` to a custom URL.

## Troubleshooting

- Check policy state in the active runtime policy file (`AIRG_POLICY_PATH`):
  - `telemetry.enabled` should be `true`
  - `telemetry.last_payload_generated_date` should match the latest generated UTC day
  - `telemetry.last_payload_uploaded_at` should advance after successful uploads
- `telemetry.last_sent_date` remains as compatibility state and updates on upload success.
- In GUI `Policy -> Advanced -> Anonymous telemetry`, use:
  - `View Status` to see generator/uploader `status` and `last run`
  - `Restart` to run workers immediately.
- Confirm AIRG service/runtime is running the expected package version (for example after upgrades/reinstalls).
- Use `AIRG_DEBUG=1` when launching AIRG to surface telemetry send errors in service logs.
